This directory contains source code for mrisim.  It has been tested with
the Silicon Graphics Delta C++ compiler (IRIX 5.3).   To build the source
cd into the directory mrisim, then make mrisim.

Release 3.1
-----------

New partial volume scheme:
A new partial volume scheme which uses Fourier resampling to model imaging
chain partial volume has been introduced.  This is now the default method.
To use the old method, the -nnpv switch has been added.

New command-line interface:
The command-line interface has been expanded to allow for new parameters
that have been introduced into the parameter files.
See the man page, and the document mrisim/doc/switch.txt.gz for a full
description of command-line options.

Release 3.0
-----------

Fuzzy label phantoms:
MRISIM now accepts fuzzy phantoms for the specification of anatomic
partial volume.

New parameter files:
The parameter file format has been changed to allow for new release
features.  Scripts files new-sequence, new-tissue, and new-coil are
available for generating new parameter files from the old ones.

Release 2.5
-----------

The Phantom model has been rewritten to be more memory efficient and to
accomodate new models in future releases.

Changes / New Features:

RF Inhomogeneity:
The receive coil field map should now have the same size as the labelled
phantom volume.  Receive map resampling is now done by the simulator.

Signal Gain:
A -gain command line switch has been added to allow a user specified
signal gain for the output volumes.

Voxel Offset:
An arbitrary voxel offset from the labelled phantom, for each dimension of
the output volume can now be specified.  If no offset is specified, the
quarter voxel shift used in previous releases is used by default.
now be specified

See the man page for details.

Release 2.0
-----------

There have been changes and restructuring in the code distribution.
This release has been tested with the Silicon Graphics Delta C++ compiler,
as well as GNU C++ (v2.4).
